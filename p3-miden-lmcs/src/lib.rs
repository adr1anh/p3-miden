//! Lifted Matrix Commitment Scheme (LMCS) for matrices with power-of-two heights.
//!
//! This crate provides a Merkle tree commitment scheme optimized for matrices that store
//! polynomial evaluations in **bit-reversed order** over multiplicative cosets.
//!
//! # Main Types
//!
//! - [`LmcsConfig`]: Configuration holding cryptographic primitives (sponge + compression)
//!   with packed types for SIMD parallelization.
//! - [`Lmcs`]: Trait for LMCS configurations, providing type-erased access to commitment operations.
//! - [`LmcsTree`]: Trait for built LMCS trees, providing opening operations.
//! - [`LiftedMerkleTree`]: The underlying Merkle tree data structure.
//! - [`Proof`]: Single-opening proof with rows, optional salt, and authentication path.
//! - [`BatchProof`]: Parsed batch opening from transcript hints.
//!
//! # API Overview
//!
//! ## Direct Usage (Simple)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use p3_miden_lmcs::{HidingLmcsConfig, Lmcs, LmcsConfig, LmcsTree};
//! use p3_miden_transcript::{ProverTranscript, VerifierTranscript};
//!
//! // Config captures PF, PD (packed types), H, C, WIDTH, DIGEST
//! // F = PF::Value and D = PD::Value are derived
//! let config = LmcsConfig::<PF, PD, _, _, WIDTH, DIGEST>::new(sponge, compress);
//! let challenger = /* ... */;
//!
//! // Build tree - no turbofish needed, packed types are known from config
//! let tree = config.build_aligned_tree(matrices);
//! let root = tree.root();
//! let mut prover_channel = ProverTranscript::new(challenger);
//! tree.prove_batch(&indices, &mut prover_channel);
//! let (_, transcript) = prover_channel.finalize();
//!
//! let mut verifier_channel = VerifierTranscript::from_data(challenger, &transcript);
//! let rows = config.open_batch(&root, &widths, log_max_height, &indices, &mut verifier_channel)?;
//!
//! // For hiding commitment with salt, use HidingLmcsConfig with RNG
//! let hiding_config =
//!     HidingLmcsConfig::<PF, PD, _, _, _, WIDTH, DIGEST, 4>::new(sponge, compress, rng);
//! let tree = hiding_config.build_aligned_tree(matrices);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Trait-Based Usage (for generic code like FRI)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use p3_miden_lmcs::{Lmcs, LmcsTree};
//! use p3_miden_transcript::ProverTranscript;
//!
//! fn commit_and_open<L: Lmcs>(lmcs: &L, matrices: Vec<impl Matrix<L::F>>) {
//!     let tree = lmcs.build_aligned_tree(matrices);
//!     let commitment = tree.root();
//!     let challenger = /* ... */;
//!     let mut channel = ProverTranscript::new(challenger);
//!     tree.prove_batch(&[0, 1, 2], &mut channel);
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Transcript Hints
//!
//! For the `LmcsConfig`/`LiftedMerkleTree` implementation in this crate, batch openings
//! are streamed as transcript hints: for each unique query index **in sorted tree index order**
//! (ascending, deduplicated), `prove_batch` writes one row per matrix (in tree
//! leaf order) followed by optional salt. After all indices, missing sibling hashes are
//! emitted level-by-level in canonical left-to-right, bottom-to-top order. Hints are not
//! observed into the Fiat-Shamir challenger.
//!
//! `LmcsConfig::open_batch` consumes only the hints it needs to reconstruct the root;
//! extra hint data is left unread. It expects `widths` and `log_max_height` to match the
//! committed tree and treats empty `indices` as invalid. Use
//! [`BatchProof::read_from_channel`](crate::BatchProof::read_from_channel) if you need to
//! parse hints without hashing; then call [`BatchProof::single_proofs`](crate::BatchProof::single_proofs)
//! with an LMCS config to reconstruct per-index proofs (keyed by index) without verifying against a
//! commitment.
//!
//! # Mathematical Foundation
//!
//! Consider a polynomial `f(X)` of degree less than `d`, and let `g` be the coset generator and
//! `K` a subgroup of order `n ≥ d` with primitive root `ω`. The coset evaluations
//! `{f(g·ω^j) : j ∈ [0, n)}` can be stored in two orderings:
//!
//! - **Canonical order**: `[f(g·ω^0), f(g·ω^1), ..., f(g·ω^{n-1})]`
//! - **Bit-reversed order**: `[f(g·ω^{bitrev(0)}), f(g·ω^{bitrev(1)}), ..., f(g·ω^{bitrev(n-1)})]`
//!
//! where `bitrev(i)` is the bit-reversal of index `i` within `log2(n)` bits.
//!
//! # Lifting by Upsampling
//!
//! When we have matrices with different heights n₀ ≤ n₁ ≤ … ≤ nₜ₋₁ (each a power of two),
//! we "lift" smaller matrices to the maximum height N = nₜ₋₁ using **nearest-neighbor
//! upsampling**: each row is repeated contiguously `r = N/n` times.
//!
//! For a matrix of height `n` lifted to `N`, the index map is: `i ↦ floor(i / r) = i >> log2(r)`
//!
//! **Example** (`n=4`, `N=8`):
//! - Original rows: `[row0, row1, row2, row3]`
//! - Upsampled: `[row0, row0, row1, row1, row2, row2, row3, row3]` (blocks of 2)
//!
//! # Why Upsampling for Bit-Reversed Data
//!
//! Given bit-reversed evaluations of `f(X)` over a coset `gK` where `|K| = n`, upsampling to
//! height `N = n · r` (where `r = 2^k`) produces the bit-reversed evaluations of `f'(X) = f(Xʳ)`
//! over the coset `gK'` where `|K'| = N`.
//!
//! Mathematically, if the input contains `f(g·(ω_n)^{bitrev_n(j)})` at index `j`, then after
//! upsampling, each index `i` in `[0, N)` maps to the original index `j = i >> k`, giving:
//!
//! ```text
//! upsampled[i] = f(g·(ω_n)^{bitrev_n(i >> k)}) = f'(g·(ω_N)^{bitrev_N(i)})
//! ```
//!
//! where `f'(X) = f(Xʳ)`. This is exactly the bit-reversed evaluation of `f'` over `gK'`.
//!
//! # Opening Semantics
//!
//! When opening at index `i`, we retrieve the value at position `i` in the bit-reversed list.
//! For the lifted polynomial `f'(X) = f(Xʳ)`, this gives `f'(g·(ω_N)^{bitrev_N(i)})`.
//!
//! Equivalently, this is `f'(g·ξ^i)` where `ξ = (ω_N)^{bitrev_N(i)}` is the `i`-th element
//! when iterating over `K'` in the order induced by bit-reversed indices.
//!
//! # Equivalence to Cyclic Lifting
//!
//! Upsampling bit-reversed data is equivalent to cyclically repeating canonically-ordered data:
//!
//! ```text
//! Upsample(BitReverse(data)) = BitReverse(Cyclic(data))
//! ```
//!
//! where cyclic repetition tiles the original `n` rows periodically: `[row0, row1, ..., row_{n-1}, row0, ...]`.
//!
//! This equivalence follows from the bit-reversal identity: for `r = N/n = 2^k`,
//! `bitrev_N(i) mod n = bitrev_n(i >> k)`.
