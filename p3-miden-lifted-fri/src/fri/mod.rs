//! # FRI Protocol Implementation
//!
//! Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof for low-degree testing.
//! Proves that a committed polynomial has degree below a target bound.
//!
//! ## Domain Convention
//!
//! This FRI implementation treats inputs as evaluations over the unshifted two-adic subgroup.
//! If the PCS evaluates over a coset `gK`, the shift is absorbed into the polynomial:
//! `Q'(X) = Q(g·X)`. The low-degree test is run on `Q'` using subgroup points.
